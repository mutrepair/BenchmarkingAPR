# CODIT: Code Editing with Tree-Based Neural Models

Most of the code in this repository are borrowed from [OpenNMY-Py](https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py)

### To get started

```
bash initialize.sh
```
This will download the data and trained models for replication. 


### To replicate Codit results, 

```
python full_translation <tree_beam_size> <token_beam_size>
```
